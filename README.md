## Work in progress ⏳

Moving forward, my focus for this website is to continue improving the presentation of artworks. 
I would like to create a homepage that shows different sections dedicated to specific types of artwork.
Each section will redirect users to dedicated web pages showcasing the collection of artworks belonging to that particular category.
