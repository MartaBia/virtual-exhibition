# Virtual Exhibition üñºÔ∏è

## About the project 

Welcome to my Virtual Exhibition powered by the V&A API! This project was a fun opportunity for me to dive into the world of the V&A Museum and create a captivating website that showcases a collection of fascinating toys.
The primary goal of this project was to explore and leverage the V&A API, utilizing its vast collection of data to curate an immersive virtual exhibition. With a passion for both technology and the arts, I wanted to create a website that not only celebrates the beauty and historical significance of toys but also serves as a testament to the power of digital platforms in bringing cultural experiences to life.

## Work in progress ‚è≥

Moving forward, my focus for this website is to continue improving the presentation of artworks. 
I would like to create a homepage that shows different sections dedicated to specific types of artwork.
Each section will redirect users to dedicated web pages showcasing the collection of artworks belonging to that particular category.
